# Book-Search-Engine

## Description 
This refactoring of an existing application, was made by taking starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

On it, we are able to **login/signup** with a *user*, then we can navigate in the navbar to search for a **book**, look at the description, and add it to our **personal list**; then, we can see our saved list, and erase them from it as we need.

### Example of running application :

## Usage
To use the application, you just need to open the provided **URL**.
